# Button
This section is not complete. On the one hand, I presented here all the variations that can be available in our system. On the other hand, only a handful of buttons are ready-to-use in our application, namely:

- Primary Contained button

<Story name="Intro">
    <Button>Primary Contained</Button>
    <Button color='secondary' variant='outlined'>Secondary Outlined</Button>
</Story>
